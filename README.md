# Churn-Project
I used historical data to run predictive analytics to predict the likelihood of his customers leaving. This will help the company determine the right strategy to retain customers who are more likely to end their relationship with us. I used customer data: their demographics, accounts, and transaction history.
Customer segmentation can be a powerful tool for building predictive features. The importance of aggregation is evaluated to determine if any customer group is more likely to unsubscribe. No clear indication of predictive clustering was observed.
Maybe a small data set of 10,000 records is a factor, as neural networks often perform better on large data sets
Size reduction did not yield positive results for this dataset.
The phenomenon of multicollinearity between the independent variables is limited. This is good for linear models, since it means that the condition for using a linear model is met. A dataset containing customer banking information is evaluated to identify factors that lead to unsubscribes and provides a machine learning solution that helps predict which customers are likely to unsubscribe.Rephrase
Several models have been developed and tested, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, k nearest neighbors, support vector machines, gradient boosting, mild GBM, and neurons. Light GBM and gradient Boost performed best with accuracy of 79.5% and 79.7%, respectively, and accuracy of 68.7% and 67.4%, respectively. 
On the business front, customers identified as churning by both models would be correct at 68.7% and 67.4%, respectively. Similar to the image above, customer churn probability can be used to make a decision, so the decision maker can choose what action to take based on the customer's probability of leaving. Various engagement initiatives can then be designed to build loyalty among strong customers and offer incentives to moderately loyal or potential loyal customers. do nothing for customers who are  essentially lost.
Basically, this solution will bring the following business benefits:
Improve customer loyalty: By accurately identifying potential customers, banks can take proactive steps to retain them. This includes launching targeted loyalty services and initiatives to retain these customers.
Improved marketing strategy: Machine learning models, especially Light GBM and Gradient Boost, have demonstrated a high degree of accuracy and precision in identifying potential abandonment cases. This means that the bank's marketing team can use these predictions to better tailor their marketing strategy. They can create personalized campaigns and offers for identified leavers, increasing their likelihood of retaining them as customers.
Cost savings: Anticipating churn is not only related to customer retention, but also to cost management. Acquiring new customers  often costs more  than retaining existing ones. By accurately identifying potential customers, banks can allocate their resources more efficiently. Instead of devoting resources to attracting new customers, a company can focus on retaining existing customers, which can result in significant cost savings. 
Data-driven decision-making: The use of machine learning models represents a move towards data-driven decision-making in the banking industry. Data-driven decisions are often more accurate and objective than decisions based solely on intuition.
Competitive advantage: Being able to predict customer churn with great accuracy can be a competitive advantage in the banking industry. Banks that manage to retain customers effectively are more likely to succeed and thrive in the highly competitive retail market. This advantage can lead to increased market share and profits. Customer satisfaction:
By proactively addressing the needs and concerns of potential customers, banks can improve overall customer satisfaction.
